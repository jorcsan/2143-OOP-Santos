## P01 - MyVector Class 2
### Jorge Santos
### Description:

This program uses a vector class of integers that can grow or shrink easily without the need to copy values over to newly allocated memory when resizing.
It also contains methods to add values, remove values, and maintain sorted values if needed. This class also needs the ability to be 
initialized with different data sources (files, other vectors, and arrays). It also has many overloaded operator that implement the existing methods,
so it  is a simpler process when manipulating it.
